# Roadmap (High Level)

- Phase 1 (Weeks 1–3): Single-modality XAI (text, audio, video)
- Phase 2 (Weeks 4–6): Fusion & alignment (text–audio, text–video, tri-modal)
- Phase 3 (Weeks 7–10): Full pipeline integration, trust/fairness, continual learning, deployment

Each week:
- Problem framing + dataset
- Baseline + experiment + ablation
- XAI/visualizations
- Deliverables: results + 3–5 page draft
