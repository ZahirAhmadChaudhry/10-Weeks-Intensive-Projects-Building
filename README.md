# DEP-10: 10-Week Intensive Projects – Multimodal Explainable AI

This repository hosts weekly plans, daily logs, research notes, and results for a 10-week sprint toward a full **multimodal explainable AI** pipeline.

## Structure
- `plans/` – Weekly plans and end-of-week summaries
- `daily/` – Daily logs (frog of the day, objectives, outcomes)
- `research/` – Literature reviews & gap analyses
- `reports/` – Weekly reports and metrics
- `docs/` – Overall roadmap and templates
- `papers/` – Drafts, outlines, and submission notes
- `scripts/` – Useful scripts (linting, repo hygiene)
- `.github/` – Issue/PR templates and labels

## Workflow
1. **Sunday 18:00** – Weekly plan PR (research-backed)
2. **Every morning 08:00** – Eat the frog: do the hardest task first
3. **Every night 21:00** – Check-in + next-day plan
4. **Saturday** – Repo cleanup + mini-report + draft polishing

> Principle: one **real** problem each week → prototype → small experiment → 3–5 page draft.
